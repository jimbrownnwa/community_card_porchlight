### **1\. Start with the world as it is**

Most local advertising is invisible.

The solo postcard that costs $800–$1,200 lands in the mailbox alone, gets a half-second glance, and then disappears into the recycling bin.  
 The Facebook ad scrolls by between a cat video and bad news.  
 The coupon magazine is a cluttered bingo card of tiny offers that all feel interchangeable.

Everyone is shouting. Almost no one is being remembered.

The small business owner feels this. They’ve tried things. They’ve “boosted a post,” printed a flyer, bought a one-off mailer. It felt expensive, lonely, and risky.

That’s the tension.

### **2\. Then introduce the alternative**

Your shared postcard is not “cheaper advertising.”

It’s a curated local billboard that sneaks into the one place every homeowner still checks every day: the mailbox.

* It’s **big**: 12" x 6.5", full color. It doesn’t whisper for attention, it *claims* it.

* It’s **curated**: 16 handpicked local businesses, no competitors elbowing each other for space.

* It’s **precise**: 2,500 homes, mostly homeowners, above-average income, in the neighborhoods that actually buy.

This isn’t a directory. It’s a tiny, local “best-of” list delivered straight to the kitchen counter.

### **3\. The real remarkability: one-per-category status**

The most remarkable part is not the size or the price.

It’s the rule: **only one business per industry.**

One roofer.  
 One chiropractor.  
 One lawn care company.  
 One house cleaner.  
 One dentist.

That turns your postcard into a **scarcity engine**:

* When you’re on the card, you’re not “one of many,” you’re **“our roofer,” “our dentist,” “our electrician”** for those 2,500 homes.

* When a homeowner finally needs that thing they’ve been putting off, they don’t have to choose from 17 Google results. The choice has already been curated for them.

* When a competitor calls later, the best spots are already taken. They’re *too late*.

You’re not selling 16 ad spots.  
 You’re offering **16 exclusive local categories**.

That’s the story.

### **4\. Tell it from the homeowner’s point of view**

When this card lands in a mailbox, it feels different:

* It’s big enough to notice.

* It’s simple enough to understand.

* It feels like a **shortlist** someone already sweated over.

The homeowner isn’t thinking “Ah, advertising.”  
 They’re thinking, “Good, I’ve been meaning to find someone for the roof / the back pain / the landscaping.”

The card lives on the fridge, in the kitchen drawer, on the counter. It becomes a **local problem-solver** they can grab when something breaks, aches, or needs upgrading.

That’s what you’re actually selling to the businesses:

“A physical shortcut to being the one they call when the problem finally hurts enough.”

### **5\. Tell it from the business owner’s point of view**

Here’s the story you can tell them:

“Most of the time, you’re competing in noisy, crowded spaces — Google, Facebook, coupon books. This is the opposite of that.

I’m sending one big, beautiful card to 2,500 of the best homes in town.  
 On that card, there is **only one business in your category.**

For $150, you get refrigerator real estate in 2,500 homes, as the *default choice* when people finally decide, ‘Okay, it’s time to fix this.’

If you get even one new customer, it more than pays for itself. Everything after that is just your margin saying ‘thank you.’

And once your category is taken, it’s gone. I won’t put another \[roofer/chiropractor/etc\] on this card. This is your spot or it’s someone else’s.”

You’re not asking them to gamble on advertising.  
 You’re inviting them to **claim a category** in a very specific, very valuable little world.

---

### **6\. Make the math part of the story, not the pitch**

Don’t lead with CPM or print cost. Tell a simple version:

* 2,500 homes

* $150

* One decent new job: the card is paid for

* More than one? They’ve just bought profitable word-of-mouth.

You can phrase it like this:

“If this card gets you just one solid customer, you’re in profit.  
 If it gets you two, three, four… you’ll wish I hadn’t capped it at 2,500 homes.”

You’re selling an **unfairly tilted experiment** in their favor.

---

### **7\. A positioning line you can use**

Pick one of these as a “Seth-ish” spine line:

* “**Locally Famous in 2,500 Homes. One Category at a Time.**”

* “**Be the One They Call When It’s Time to Fix Something.**”

* “**Your Business on the Fridge, Not Lost in the Feed.**”

* “**One Card. One Neighborhood. One Business Per Category.**”
